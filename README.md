# #PolíticaEnFoco

PolíticaEnFoco analyzes political videos and generates easy-to-understand insights, making it simple for users to stay informed. 

A voice recognition software to identify speeches in live congressional broadcasts and classify statements by speaker. We summarize the content and analyze the validity of their arguments.
At the same time it provides learning resources, news that are web-scrapped and and functionality to explain the news and the impact. 

## How we built it
We used Whisper voice recognition software to identify speeches in live congressional broadcasts and classify statements by speaker. Using the Ollama model, we summarize the content and analyze the validity of their arguments.
With Ollama the news can be explained to us in a more simpler way, and the web application also provides friendly-learning resources.


We’re proud to have developed a working prototype that empowers citizens to engage with politics more easily.
